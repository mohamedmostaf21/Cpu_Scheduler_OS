# Cpu_Scheduler_OS
- This project is for Operating System Course.
- Language: C#
- Development environment: Visual Studio
- Platform: .NET Framework
- Project type: Windows Forms Application
## Aim
implement a static and dynamic scheduler that supports 
1. FCFS
2. SJF (Preemptive and Non Preemptive)
3. Priority (Preemptive and Non Preemptive) (the smaller the priority number the higher the priority)
4. Round Robin.
## Procedure Details
-  A live scheduler is run with each 1 unit of time mapped to 1 second
- Remaining burst time table is updated as time progresses.
- An option to run the currently existing processes only without live scheduling must be available.
## Output
- Timeline showing the order and time taken by each process (Gantt Chart) drawn
live.
- Average waiting time and average turnaround time
- Remaining burst time updated table live
## Extra Features
- user can enter big numbers in  arrival time
- user can enter big numbers in  burst time
- user can enter big numbers in  number of processes
- user can make big idle time between processes
- user can pause scheduler and resume it during live scheduling
- user can switch from preemptive to non-preemptive, or vice versa during live scheduling
- jump in time option during live scheduling
- speed up or down option during live scheduling
- reset option
